# CashbookAPI
This is a REST API designed to help my father with his accounting by replacing his excel spread sheet with a more streamlined and focused implementation. This API will act as the backend to support what will likely be a React PWA front end. 

This is my first time writing an API and is also my first time writing with .NET Core and C# so I am hoping this project will help improve my skills. I am working on this project inbetween my assignments at university so progress may appear a bit slow when checking the project history.
